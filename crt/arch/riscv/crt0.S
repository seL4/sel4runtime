/*
 * RISC-V uses the gp (global pointer) to provide a link-time
 * optimisation. It is kept in a location near the most-used symbols in
 * the text segments for any particular section of code.
 *
 * This means that a single instruction can be used to jump to a small
 * offset from the gp rather than 2 or more instructions to do a far
 * jump to an absolute address.
 *
 * The initial location for this is only known at the final link stage
 * before assembly of the static image. This code below uses a
 * replacement from the linker to set the value of the gp.
 *
 * Relaxation must be disabled when this value is set, otherwise parts
 * of this code may be optimised away.
